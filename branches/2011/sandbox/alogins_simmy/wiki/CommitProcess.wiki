#summary The definition of our commit process.

= Introduction =

In order to maintain the quality of our project's code, prevent from regressions and keep it documented we use the following sequence of actions that precedes every commit to the main trunk.

 * Test your changed version with unit tests. 

 * Create a branch with the proposed change.

 * Request a review of new branch's changed.

 * After an approval was given, merge the branch with the main trunk.

 * If new functionality was added, document it in wiki and/or report to the team at class hours.
