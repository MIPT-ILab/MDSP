#summary Using Doxygen for generating a documentation of source code.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Doxygen is a documentation generator for the programming languages C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java etc. Doxygen can create documentation as html, Latex,man ,rtf and XML format. I think that html format is more useful and convenient.


= How to install =

Doxygen runs on most Unix-like system in command line. But there are versions for Linux and Windows. Also there is GUI for user-friendly creating config file.
== Linux ==
Simplest way for installation Doxygen on Linux is use apt-get, aptitude etc. Example for Ubuntu:
{{{
sudo apt-get install doxygen
 }}}
And for installing GUI:
{{{
sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
}}}
Also you can compiled Doxygen from sources or install from binary:
    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc

== Windows ==
To install on Windows you need to download self-extracting archive from here:
  http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/doxygen-1.7.2-setup.exe
or  
  http://sourceforge.net/downloads/doxygen/
= How to use =
Doxygen uses config file to work, so there are two ways to make it.
First of them is to create template:
{{{
doxygen -g <name of config file>
}}}
Then you need to edit this file. Information about configuration file and tags you can find here:
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/config.html

Or you can use Doxygen GUI - Doxywizard. This is quite simple.

After the creation config file:
{{{
doxygen <name of config file>
}}}
Result will be in directory you wrote in config file:
{{{
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = C:/Users/User/Documents/Mdsp/doxygen
}}}

Doxygen extracts documentation from source file comments. Comment must be begin with double star or 3 slashes. Make sure the parameter EXTRACT_ALL in the config file is set to YES. So there is a example of comment.
{{{
/**
 * @file    ...
 * @author  ...
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @section LICENSE
 * GNU 
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The time class represents a moment of time.
 */
 
class Time 
{
    public:
       /**
        * Constructor that sets the time to a given value.
        * 
        * @param timemillis Number of milliseconds 
        */
       Time (int timemillis)
       {
           ...
       }

       /**
        * Get the current time.
        *
        * @return A time object set to the current time.
        */
       static Time now( )
       {
           ...
       }
};
}}}
Alternative form:
{{{
       /**
        * Constructor that sets the time to a given value.
        * 
        */
       Time (int timemillis ///< Number of milliseconds
            ) 
       {
           ...
       }

}}}
