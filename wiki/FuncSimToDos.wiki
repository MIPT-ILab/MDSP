#summary Some notes on things to improve in our current code base of FuncSim.

There are presented some notes on current status FuncSim

= Build =

 * Modify Makefile/VCPROJ to have Debug/Release builds

= FuncSim =

 * Change all error reporting made with 
{{{
cout < "Error";
assert(0);
}}}

 to throwing STL exceptions.

 * Add support of several types of binary files to load (or just stubs for them) at least RAW and ELF (it's possible to use external library libelf for this).

 * Extend decoder support.
 * modify `Code::run()` method to receive the amount of instructions requested and return the amount of instructions really done.

 * Separate the program to semantics library and scheduler.
