#summary Some notes on things to improve in our current code base.
#labels Todo

= Build =

 * Modify Makefile/VCPROJ to have Debug/Release builds

= FuncSim =

 * Change all error reporting made with 
{{{
cout < "Error";
assert(0);
}}}

 to throwing STL exceptions.

 * Add support of several types of binary files to load (or just stubs for them) at least RAW and ELF (it's possible to use external libraries for this)
