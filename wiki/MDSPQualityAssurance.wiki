= Regular testing =

A special Bash script, `mdsp_test_suite.sh`, is deployed on several (_currently one_) servers to do certain tasks on a regular basis (currently twice per week):
 # Fetch the latest SVN head.
 # Build the source.
 # Run unit test programs.
 # Run full simulation process (*NOT IMPLEMENTED YET*).
 # Mail the results to the mailing list.
