= CodingStyle =

Good C/C++ coding conventions of MIPT-VIS project are described  [http://code.google.com/p/mipt-vis/wiki/CodingStyle here]. They are also applicable for our project and should be used for any new code added.

= Automated code style checks =

It is possible to use certain third-party programs to check and correct the coding style.

For example, see http://universalindent.sourceforge.net/ for a GUI front-end for many of such tools.
