#summary Methods of building the programs of our project.

= Introduction =

Currently our source code produces three binaries: `funcsim`, `asm` and `test`. They all are usually built in the same compile/link run.

= Visual Studio =

If you have opened the IDE with `mdsp.sln` solution then you can build it with `Ctrl-Shift-B` default key combination or through "Build->Build Solution" menu.

Alternatively, you can build the solution froma command line with 
{{{
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe mdsp.sln /build
}}}

Be sure to use the correct path to *DEVENV.EXE* (`C:\Program Files\...`).
`/build` flag tells Visual Studio to build the solution file specified (`mdsp.sln`)

After the command is succesfully finished, the new binaries will appear in `Debug/` or `Release/` folder. To specify the configuration different from default use the following lines:
{{{
DEVENV.EXE /build "Debug|Win32" mdsp.sln
DEVENV.EXE /build "Release|Win32" mdsp.sln
}}}


You can also try the following flags: `/rebuild`, `/clean`,
