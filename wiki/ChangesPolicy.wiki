#summary Changes policy


= Commit prefixes =
To easily distinguish between different parts of our SVN it is required that any commit message is preceded with special tag added by commit author:

`[wiki]` - if change of a wiki page is made.

`[branch]` - if a private branch is modified.

`[trunk]` - if changes go to main trunk.
