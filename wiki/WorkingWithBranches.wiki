= Introduction =

This page is not a guide yet, because the experiments are just started. Don't rely on info located on it.

= To create a branch and switch to it =

From the root of your SVN working copy:
{{{
svn copy . https://mdsp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/new-branch-name -m 'reason of creation'

svn switch https://mdsp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/new-branch-name

}}}


= To request the review =

To be done.

 * Go to http://
 * Press "ask for review" button
 * wait the  mentor to make a review.
 * read the results - if your code is accepted then proceed to mergin your changes into main trunk.

= To merge the branch to main trunk = 

 # Get a working copy (WC) of *main trunk*, not a branch!
   `svn checkout https://mdsp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk`
 # Remember the number of revision when your branch was created. Suppose it is *250*.
 # Inside the trunk WC run the command:
   {{{
svn merge -r 250:HEAD https://mdsp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/new-branch-name
}}}
   {{{250:HEAD}}} is a range of revisions since the moment of branch creation to its latest version.
 # Now your WC of trunk has merged version of the branch and the changes from trunk. If you have some messages of conflicts, resolve them (_how? this is another story..._), if everything is OK, proceed to the next step.
 # Commit the changes to the main trunk:
  `svn commit -m 'Merged with new-branch-name'`
 # Congratulations! Now your work is available to the whole team. Hope you've done it well.
