WARNING! New core.cpp was tested only on Visual Studio 2008. (makefile isn't tested now. I'll do it soon.)

1) My name and surname in members.txt were interchanged.
2) Two strings in core.cpp were interchanged:
before

        /* Add 4 bytes (32 bits) to access next instruction */
        this->pc = this->pc + 4;

        /* Execute operation */
        op->execute();
        delete( op);

after

        /* Execute operation */
        op->execute();
        delete( op);

        /* Add 4 bytes (32 bits) to access next instruction */
        this->pc = this->pc + 4;
