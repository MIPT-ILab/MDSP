WARNING! New core.cpp was tested only on Visual Studio 2008. (makefile isn't tested now. I'll do it soon.)

1) My name and surname in members.txt are interchanged.
surname-name -> name-surname

2) Two strings in core.cpp are interchanged:
before

        /* Add 4 bytes (32 bits) to access next instruction */
        this->pc = this->pc + 4;

        /* Execute operation */
        op->execute();
        delete( op);

after

        /* Execute operation */
        op->execute();
        delete( op);

        /* Add 4 bytes (32 bits) to access next instruction */
        this->pc = this->pc + 4;

3) Two strings are added in operation.cpp after void Operation::execute():

	/* Print "execute" and current PC */
	cout << "execute PC=0x" << core->GetPC() << endl;

I think hex format of output is more comfortable than decimal. In addition I dont know how to change it. Also I have a doubt about the need for comment. I think second string is quite clear.
